How long did this take (estimate)?
Around 3–4 hours total.

What were the enjoyable aspects of the lab?
Seeing the visualizations actually respond to window resizing was really satisfying. The annotations were also cool to experiment with.

What were the challenging parts of this lab?
Had issues with the scatterplot Y-axis getting cut off — it was a sizing issue I didn’t catch right away. The annotations in the line chart were tricky; some didn’t render because of wrong positioning or missing coordinates.
Also, my annotation vis doesn't look quite right - I'm having trouble adding the extra annotations.
Also, having trouble with the overall html.
